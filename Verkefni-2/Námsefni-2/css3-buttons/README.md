# CSS3 Buttons

This is a collection of buttons that show what is possible using CSS3 and other advanced techniques, while maintaining the simplest possible markup. These buttons look best in Chrome and Safari (especially on OSX). They look almost as good in Firefox, with all other browsers falling back to a less-styled button.

These buttons are now implemented using Sass, with help from [Bourbon](http://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon). The generated CSS for all the buttons is also available.

If you'd like to modify the repo locally, you can start the Jekyll server and watch the Sass files with:

    rake server
